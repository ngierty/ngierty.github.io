Hello! My name is Naomi and I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Applied Statistics at the University of Michigan. I received my Bachelors Degree in Mathematics and Economics from Emory University in 2015 before working for two years at The Brattle Group, an economic consulting company, as a Research Analyst.

I am interested in all aspects of Applied Statistics, with my primary interests lying in consulting, astronomy/physics, and model development for business and government projects. I have experience programming in STATA, R, and Python. I welcome opportunities to grow as a statistician and problem solver!
